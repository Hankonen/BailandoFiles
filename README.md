# BailandoFiles
Android application mainly to copy files from your phones memory to SMB share.

I used smbj-wrapper library for connecting to smb share:

This was my first Android application project and it's still very much in development. 
At the moment you can connect to your smb share and paste files there but there's a lot of bugs still and the UI needs much refinement.
Code also needs much cleaning..
